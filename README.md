# Object-Tracking-single-cpu

C++ and Matlab code for object tracking.

1. Label the ground truth position of object with LabelingGT.m in /LabelingMatlabProgram/
2. /NickPFTracking_hybrid/ contains the C++ code for object tracking with hybrid resampling algorithm.
3. /NickPFTracking_adaptive/ contains the C++ code for object tracking with adaptive resampling algorithm. In adaptive algorithm, the adaptive ratio needs to be predefined. 
4. The features of the targets can be defined for object tracking.
